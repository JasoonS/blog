How do you get hold of eth?</p>\n<p>Well… you buy it. Next question, how do I buy it and how do I use it?</p>\n<h2>Web3 provider</h2>\n<p>Here you will use something called a ‘web3 provider’. This is a 3rd party application that will allow you to hold eth and interact with an ‘decentralised application (app)’ like wildcards running on ethereum.</p>\n<p>We have given you 6 different web3 provider options to use and facilitate this process. Each has a slightly different way of working that may suit you best. E.g.\nTorus (with google), lets you create an account with google then fund your account using a credit card. See a summary at the end of the web3 providers.</p>\n<h2>I need help</h2>\n<p>We are on crisp (chat tool bottom right of wildcards website) to help walk you through the entire process if you are lost :)</p>\n<h2>Why is this so hard?</h2>\n<p>Blockchain is the bleeding edge of technology and still has a long way to go.
