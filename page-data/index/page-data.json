It feels a bit like you are given a blank canvas. No rules. No limitations. Just try to think of the coolest and craziest possible ideas, get together some friends, and build them!</p>\n<p>Berlin, Bangalore, Cape Town, London and Paris are some of the epic destinations we’ve (our team wildcards) hacked at so far. I’ll never forget brainstorming till 3am in India’s most dodgy hostel. Jason Smythe was so excited about our idea he was regularly throwing in legit dance moves during the conversation.</p>\n<p>The next stop was going to be Turin, Italy for the exciting ETHTurin. Obviously, Italy in the flesh right now, was not exactly an option #COVID19. Fortunately, this didn’t stop us or the organizers, as it became an awesome virtual affair.</p>\n<p>About a year ago, we built wildcards, a platform connecting animal conversations to environmentalists, through a social and gamified experience. For this hackathon, we were brainstorming ways that we could allow our users to govern wildcards as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Thought number one: Since we raise funds conservation, why not let the users who contribute funds vote for which conservation the funds should be directed towards?</p>\n<p>Thought number two: Why not use the trendy Quadratic Voting as our governance mechanism?</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/e1d7b/400nxr.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 80.16129032258064%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Quadratic Voting\"\n        title=\"Quadratic voting so hot right now!\"\n        src=\"/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/c739e/400nxr.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/8ee9c/400nxr.jpg 148w,\n/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/ebbe7/400nxr.jpg 295w,\n/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/c739e/400nxr.jpg 590w,\n/static/4f9530d40d7cc864fe9bc4742139fe41/e1d7b/400nxr.jpg 620w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>If you are lost, do not fear.

I.e. a vote of size 9 will have a power of 3, a vote of size 100 will only have a power 10 etc. The desired result is that users with large amounts of voting power cannot radically swing the result toward one specific candidate. \nThe idea of Quadratic voting is explored extensively in the book, Radical Economics, and therefore named after one author Glen Weyl.</p>\n<p>Who gets to vote?\nAnyone who is the guardian of a wildcard, is rewarded with 1 wildcard loyalty token per day. The guardian can then use these loyalty tokens to vote for the conservation that they believe should receive the funds raised from Glen the Dragon. The vote will happen on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>That’s it! We are super stoked that we managed to nab 3rd place at the ETHTurin hackathon. Thanks to Denham Preen, Jason Smythe and Andrew Stanger for being such cool teammates. \nIt’s time to grab a wildcard and start voting on where you want to see the money go!</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Join us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2020","title":"Community governance through quadratic voting at Italy's first Ethereum hackathon [Remote edition]","description":"We are launching a new wildcard (Glen the Dragon) in the next 48 hours!

This signature is publicly verifiable to have only been signed by the owner of the account.</p>\n<p>This is only half of the problem though, I could for example sign a message that says “I am the @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">realDonaldTrump</a>” but that is rather meaningless, unless I post that from the correct twitter account (namely Donald Trump’s twitter account). That is exactly what we require from you, that you post the signed message from a twitter account that you own.</p>\n<h3>Step by step guide</h3>\n<p>To verify you own a Wildcard you need to own a wildcard first.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on your wildcard to go to the detailed view (eg. <a href=\"https://wildcards.world/#details/andy\">https://wildcards.world/#details/andy</a>).</li>\n<li>Click on the “<em>Verify</em>” button under your wildcard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VuI2hbJK_CkAbJqpfabl_g.png\"></p>\n<p>3.

If you believe that people today or in the future will value and appreciate that you did a good deed of donating money to a wildlife conservation, then your contribution is an investment into your reputation. Dollars and Euros are not the only things that people value, thankfully.</p>\n<p>It works the other way around too! Everyone has existing social capital, and validating your identity to owning a Wildcard imbues some of that social capital to the Wildcard. And this has the potential to make the wildcard more valuable, which thankfully isn’t a selfish thing — wildcards never stop generating funds for wildlife conservation.</p>\n<h4>Here is a concrete example from Wildcards history:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>On <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc5d83b4bca45495fbb26c52ff08b6b4b30659716d4fa3ccdfc0cf35adadb42c9\">_Jun-27–2019 04:46:08 PM +UT_C</a> <a href=\"https://wildcards.world/#details/vitalik\">Vitalik</a> was born. He cost 0 ether — humble beginnings.</li>\n<li>Over the next day it was traded and the price was changed a number of times. It price fluctuated, and it changed hands: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1d41bebcec93a17ebbd13897a0a57c0f316c06681839be9094ef03224e7a0252\">0.0002</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89d1c1dc0f712aa90e3d820a92d2b3e64cbc3826dd7a76f932a023e002a820f6\">0.4</a> ETH, …<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc06e9f1dae62c92905712362715eadb84c8ef48056ee67ffd1a178d6faafe5bd\">, 0.15</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61d7cc955bcfe42c81a3c557f7cc5c610cdaf0042d74cb8c628f64de1eaa588d\">0.25</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5252f6c22288950b92997934a3491656f2c12f7ba1299902f61eef4806312455\">1.7</a> ETH. All this time Wildcards was generating money for wildlife conservation.</li>\n<li>And then, on the Jun-28–2019 09:31:46 AM +UTC, it was bought for 1.7 ETH and the price was set to 20ETH (3665.80 USD) by someone who clearly believes in our project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vitalik has a monthly pledge rate of 2.5% of its self assessed value. This means at its current price of 20ETH the owner pays 0.5 ETH (91.54 USD)per month to hold this token. This means that if someone buys Vitalik from them for 20ETH within 36.6 months they make a guaranteed profit. I would say that is a decent amount of incentive for someone to use their social capital to promote Wildcards and its case. And thus — the idea of <a href=\"https://blog.simondlr.com/exploring-harberger-tax-in-patronage-markets\">Patronage Markets</a> starts to come into reality.</p>\n<p>As it happens, we do know who the owner of Vitalik is, and they have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simondlr/status/1144540641516539904\">been public about it</a>. But we hope to make this easier for other patrons on the Wildcards platform in the future.</p>\n<p>We are constantly working on new features to further integrate the human and fun side of patronage markets via gamification, stay tuned as these new ideas are implemented.</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 22, 2019","title":"Let the world know about your contributions","description":"Wildcards is excited to announce a new feature, cryptographically verifiable attestations of identity!"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Where is the money going?

It signifies that this is actually working, and money is going to beloved animals we are trying to protect. So, let’s break this number down step by step to help quantify its impact so far. \n It is:\n1 buffalo reintroduced into the wild or\n2 months of a ranger’s salary or\n3 times 0.843 Eth or \n…\n2022 bananas\nOne more crucial figure… it is only 0.0000006% of the <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/conservation-will-cost-76-billion-40357\">yearly amount</a> needed to preserve conservation! Basically, we are just getting started and have ambitious goals to drastically increase this number.</p>\n<h2>Is team wildcards going to raise a bunch of money then flee to the Bahamas and listen to No Women No Cry while buying cocktails with bitcoin?</h2>\n<p>Obviously, this is a valid concern, we love Bob Marley. In serious terms, we recognize that the money cannot continue to flow through us toward the conservation, as this requires everyone to trust team wildcards, and we all know that is the thing least liked by the decentralized community. \nLuckily we are flipping Ninjas when it comes to smart contracts and so we can change the address that receives the funds. The funds generated will flow directly to the public address of an organization. The organization will verify their address on twitter or through their website. Trust is then held at the organization level.</p>\n<p>Visit our website <a href=\"https://wildcards.world\">Wildcards</a> where you can buy some wildcards and start contributing toward endangered animal conservation today!

Surely blockchain, the foundation of bitcoin, the pioneer of decentralized finance, can be extended to solve some of humanities greatest problems? This was our motivation.</p>\n<p>After a few german beers and lots of ideation on the Friday night preceding the hackathon, we believed we had found a way to create a well incentivized, transparent carbon credit market. Overall it would be useful in stimulating carbon offset farming and combating climate change. Come on boys, lets make Greta proud!</p>\n<h3>Supply?</h3>\n<p>Coming from South Africa, we were aware of a special plant called spekboom that is cheap, easy to grow in arid land, and very effective at offsetting carbon emissions. Why not grow spekboom in idle, arid landscapes in the karoo of South Africa to offset carbon emissions?</p>\n<h3>Demand?</h3>\n<p>Energy use and hence emission levels are predicted to keep rising over time. Entities and individuals are interested in an easy and transparent solution to verify that they have offset their carbon emissions, and are thus carbon neutral.</p>\n<h3>Linking supply and demand</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://carboncredits.club/\">Carboncredits.club</a> combines interesting economic mechanisms with cutting edge tech in order to link carbon offsetting farmers to entities worldwide in a radical new market.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The farmers will grow hectares of spekboom plantation that will be represented as NFT’s.</li>\n<li>Each hectare of spekboom offsets 10 tons of carbon emission per year.</li>\n<li>Entities/individuals will buy these spekboom NFTs, where the holder of a NFT has the right to claim the carbon offset from that particular NFT.</li>\n<li>When holding a spekboom NFT, erc20 tokens, called ‘Carbon Credits’ are automatically minted and credited to your public address over time as you hold the NFT.</li>\n<li>I.e. If you hold a 1 hectare spekboom NFT for 1 year, 10 carbon credits will have been minted and sent to your account (all handled transparently and programmatically through our smart contract implementation).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here it starts to get interesting!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure a liquid market and incentivize the farmers, spekboom NFT’s are always for sale.</li>\n<li>Whenever the NFT is bought, immediately the buyer must set a new selling price.</li>\n<li>The buyer then pays a percentage of that selling price each month toward the farmer, as a fee for holding the right to claim the carbon offset generated by that land.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entities are finally able to ‘burn’ carbon credits, to verifiably and transparently show the amount (tons) of carbon they have offset.</p>\n<p>All this results in some cool outcomes like a transparent secondary market for carbon credit trading, as well as introducing the chance for early adopters to even profit through the higher resale of their spekboom NFT’s as demand for carbon credits increase.</p>\n<p>Want to learn more?

Inspired by Simon de la Rouviere’s <a href=\"https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/\">This Artwork is Always on Sale</a> and Glen Weyl and Eric Posner’s <a href=\"http://radicalmarkets.com/\">Radical Markets</a>. We’ve got it! </p>\n<p>We start coding again. Renewed energy, we have this! We help ourselves to more free food and refreshments, organic energy drinks and kombucha. We code, we think, we talk, we get mentored by the network of incredible mentors and we code some more. Around midnight we are treated to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/larozell/\">authentic crêpes</a>. The team is squinting into our computers by 4:30 am. There are still 50 or so, out of the 190 hackers suited in hoodies and headphones hacking around us, some sleeping at the table. We retreat to one of the previous talk venues to where mattresses have been laid out. We cross Andy Tudhope, one of EthCapeTown’s Judges from <a href=\"https://status.im/\">Status</a>, reading his book. We “team sleep” for 2 hours and wake up back to our computers where the sun is rising through the glass ocean-facing wall. </p>\n<p>At some point, Vitalik nonchalantly arrives and sits at one of the desks at his Thinkpad. EthCapeTown is waking up again and the food trucks open their flaps. We are frantically coding trying to build a working product. We deploy to the testnet, we spruce up the front end and with 3min to go, we make a video demo to explain what we built. We are finished, physically too, the hacking is over, its time for presentations.   </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/e2288/ethcapetown.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Winners\"\n        title=\"Wildcards are winners of EthCapeTown 2019\"\n        src=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/c739e/ethcapetown.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/8ee9c/ethcapetown.jpg 148w,\n/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/ebbe7/ethcapetown.jpg 295w,\n/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/c739e/ethcapetown.jpg 590w,\n/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/e2288/ethcapetown.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>We watch the other awesome projects present through fuzzy brains.

Hence, we say that our wildcards are ‘always for sale’.</p>\n<h2>How are wildcards always for sale?</h2>\n<p>This is what is actually super cool and unique about wildcards. We have leveraged an idea from a book called ‘radical markets’, that proposes a fascinating ‘always for sale mechanism’.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, whenever someone buys a wildcard, they are immediately required to set a selling price for that wildcard. Therefore, the wildcard can at anytime be bought for that selling price, and is ‘always for sale’. The interesting economic dynamic is that the owner of the wildcard pays a percentage based fee on the selling price they set (known as harberger tax).\nIf you are lost… don’t worry — we made this cool little video which should hopefully explain it a bit better :)</p>\n<p>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/63qtVVmcpmU\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe></div>\n          </div>\n          </p>\n<h2>Why are we in Paris?</h2>\n<p>Our team was selected to be part of Ubisoft Entrepreneurs lab in Station F, Paris.

We work with each startup batch for a six-month long season, striving to create valuable collaborations between each startup and the Ubisoft Group as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Shhhh… we have partnered with an amazing conservation organisation that will help distribute funds generated from this project. More details to follow soon!\nMore good news! We are going to release a bunch of new wildcards next week — and more and more over the coming weeks and months during our time in Paris!</p>\n<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>\n<p>Visit our website <a href=\"https://wildcards.world\">Wildcards</a> where you can go ahead, buy a wildcard, and start contributing toward endangered animal conservation.</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/55b1e489873ad2174c5459e1b6f1e3dc/thuggorilla.gif\" alt=\"thuglife\" title=\"Thuglife harberger tax\"></p>\n<p>Stay tuned,</p>\n<p>Team Wildcards</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 09, 2019","title":"Welcome to wildcards","description":"Wildcards is always for sale conservation crypto tokens built on Ethereum."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
