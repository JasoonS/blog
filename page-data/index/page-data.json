Chaos and confusion erupted. Whilst signalling a warning through wild arm gestures and shouting to those still in the water, panicked surfers frantically clawed to the safety of the shore. Hysteria spread through the waves packed with surfers along Muizenberg Beach, a 20km popular surfing beach in Cape Town, South Africa. At the time, big wave surfer Greg Bertish was teaching some friends to surf. When the warning finally reached them, they scrambled to join the mass exodus. Once Greg and his friends were safely on the sand, it took a further quarter of an hour for the remaining surfers to heed the warning and get out of the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Is killing sharks the only solution?</strong></p>\n<p>Months after the incident Greg’s thoughts kept circling back to that shark scare day, and he ruminated over the series of shark incidents that had happened that year. Potential solutions to mitigate human shark interactions were continuously discussed in 2004. Sadly, all these “solutions” were focussed on culling sharks, the logic being that fewer sharks would equal fewer shark incidents. The culling methods included shooting sharks, deploying shark nets (which not only snare sharks but also kill large marine animals including dolphins, turtles and even whales) and deploying drum lines (large baited hooks which are also notorious for indiscriminately killing marine life). Human shark interaction mitigation discussions dragged on and on until Greg took the matter into his own hands. He came up with a solution that drew on his deep love, connection, and knowledge of the ocean as well as his lifesaving experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*GvleYu1a969CNPIN\" alt=\"(Photograph by Gerald Schömbs)\"><em>(Photograph by Gerald Schömbs)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Military service in a speedo</strong></p>\n<p>During his compulsory military service, Greg had joined lifesaving. This allowed him to spend some of his guard duty in a speedo, at the beach, during his days of National Service. From his brother’s work with fishermen, he knew that scouts were sent up the mountain behind Muizenberg beach to locate where the schools of fish were and that the scouts occasionally saw big sharks cruising into the bay. From this knowledge Greg came up with the prototype for “Shark Spotters”, a non-lethal solution to mitigate human shark interactions. The City of Cape Town was initially skeptical of the idea, but Greg pushed ahead with it anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>The not so legal start to Shark Spotters</strong></p>\n<p>In the dead of night, Greg and his brother-in-law slinked down to the toilet block at Muizenberg beach and illegally bolted an old war siren and a flag pole to it. He and friends, Dave and Fiona Chudleigh from Surf Shack, initially recruited Monwabisi, an unemployed lifeguard, and Rasta, a car guard, as the first two members of the Shark Spotters crew. Monwabisi was stationed on the mountain with binoculars looking out for sharks and the Rasta on the beach. When a shark was spotted Monwabisi would radio Rasta, who would then sound the siren and raise a shark flag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Kq13ZB2W_mE5ux5W\" alt=\"© Sean Geer\"><em>© Sean Geer</em></p>\n<p><strong>From humble beginnings</strong></p>\n<p>The project has evolved and expanded immensely over the years. Shark Spotters now covers four beaches all year round and six beaches over the summer season. In summer great white sharks tend to spend more time near the shore feeding on fish, rays and smaller shark species as their winter food supply of baby seals learn predator avoidance strategies and become harder to catch. Summer also brings hoards of swimmers and surfers to the beaches, and this is where the potential for conflict begins. Shark Spotters have a colour-coded flag system to indicate how recently a shark was seen, as well as how likely a shark being able to be detected is, which is largely based on the water and weather conditions. This non-lethal shark interaction mitigation method is the first of its kind, and the City of Cape Town is now fully onboard with the project and together with Save Our Seas Foundation provide the majority of their funding. Shark Spotters employs over 40 people from previously disadvantaged communities. These employees are trained in first aid and many educate their communities about sharks and shark activity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*ZA8mYElLPSOloUUg\" alt=\"The Shark Spotters team © Marike Herselman.\"><em>The Shark Spotters team © Marike Herselman.</em></p>\n<p><strong>We protect only what we understand</strong></p>\n<p>Shark Spotters educates people about sharks and clarifies why we, as humans, need them.

And this happens year after year.</p>\n<p>We know that dragonflies need to lay their eggs in freshwater in order to reproduce, but the Maldives is made up of sandbanks and has no surface freshwater which brings us to the question: where are these dragonflies laying their eggs?</p>\n<p>A curious scientist in the Maldives got his friends in the Seychelles, India, and Africa to record the dates of when they saw swarms of dragonflies. From the dates they gathered, the scientist suspected that the little dragonflies were doing massive migrations over the Indian ocean. Further research revealed this was indeed true, and that an individual Wandering Glider dragonfly (<em>Pantala flavescens</em>) can fly 6,000 km without landing. This is the longest migration of any insect! Over four generations these little Wandering Glider dragonflies do an annual tag-team round-trip of 18,000 km from India to East Africa, then South Africa and back again along the same route.</p>\n<p>Sadly, not all species movements are seasonal. Not all species that disappear from an area will return, some will vanish forever. Changes in climate, a compromised or destroyed habitat, or invasion by a rival, alien species can cause an entire species to become extinct.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0*m-L1RvH_G8go5GCI\" alt=\"This is one of the 1054 records of Wandering Glider dragonflies (Pantala flavescens) logged in the Biodiversity and Development Institute’s Virtual Museum.

All their records are neatly digitally stored and organized in the Virtual Museum. This data is vital as it allows the movement of species to be tracked, enabling early detection of changes that are out of line with natural cycles. They are positioned to sound the alarm and, if need be, initiate efforts to quickly haul species away from the precipice of extinction. Already, the BDI has detected a westward range shift in a number of butterfly species. But it’s not all about recording the demise of species and frantically trying to prevent it. For the BDI, it is also about detecting the recovery of species.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*UyBINMi-Sc668LuV\" alt=\"African Blue Pansy’s (*Junonia orithya madagascariensis*) is one of the butterfly species whose distribution is shifting west.

The BDI researchers are helping to continue African Black Oystercatchers counts and breeding monitoring on Robben Island. In order to reduce disturbance when monitoring nests the BDI even developed apps to optimise data collection time. From the data they collected, the BDI has documented a four-fold increase in the number of birds on the island since population monitoring began 20 years ago and African Black Oystercatchers are once again a common sight along southern African shores.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2290/1*duzSa3FwAk-y3LXzFBmN6g.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>What does an emeritus stats professor, a tech entrepreneur, and an ecologist have in common?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, a love of conservation, because together they direct the Biodiversity and Development Institute. Along with their researchers and interns, they lead a dedicated army of more than 2000 committed citizen scientists who are distributed across Africa. These citizen scientists typically snap photos of organisms and upload them with details regarding where and when they found it. Some citizen scientists also ring birds for tracking and record details about the birds’ condition, size, weight, and moult stage (which is very useful in understanding how climate change is affecting their natural cycles). Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the BDI works tirelessly to manage and analyse the data they collect and add historical records to their databases. The BDI also does something else. Something really incredible…</p>\n<p><strong>We protect only what we love, we love only what we understand, but we can only be motivated to understand it if we know it’s there…</strong></p>\n<p>The BDI encourages people to open their eyes and truly notice and appreciate the incredible life around them. By engaging people’s fascination with nature, people are more likely to value and protect it. This “nature” doesn’t only refer to the great outdoors, it is also about identifying the gecko on your kitchen ceiling, the insect in your flowerpot, and the birds drinking nectar from your flowers, especially during 2020’s lockdown. The BDI is seeing more and more entries like these and these “at home” entries are helping them understand how wildlife uses urban spaces better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*3noc0i1GG1kBVCYL.jpg\" alt=\"While locked down in the Western Cape, South Africa citizen scientist G.J.

They constantly host events and keep their community of citizen scientists up to date with newsletters about new developments. The First BDI Citizen Scientist Conference took place in the Karoo Gariep Nature Reserve in February 2020. Since the COVID-19 lockdown, the BDI has initiated Citizen Scientist Hours and events using the Zoom platform. These have been enthusiastically attended by citizen scientists from all over Africa.</p>\n<p>The BDI believes the most important thing about citizen science is the impact that participation has on those involved and the scientific value of the data, and the data’s value for conservation planning and priority setting. Participation in projects helps to make people alert to changes in habitats and fosters civic awareness, especially as the places where they used to find birds and butterflies disappear. The BDI aims to strengthen the development of groups of people who are aware of the importance and value of the environment, and who can be ambassadors for biodiversity in their communities.</p>\n<p><strong>BDI partners with Wildcards!</strong></p>\n<p>New wildcards have been launched to raise funds for the BDI!

Fundraising events and ecotourism are on hold; traditional streams of funding are strapped for cash; private contributors have donor fatigue and organisations everywhere are anxious about what the future holds. As food becomes scarce and poverty rises, the adverse effects on wildlife increases. Hunting for bushmeat and poaching for exotic animal parts are intensifying. How long will we feel the effects of Covid-19?</p>\n<p>Wildcards is an unconventional strategy that is able to harness funding for conservation while simultaneously providing entertainment and dare we say, fun.</p>\n<p>Gamification and conservation are an unusual marriage, but with cryptocurrency acting as their glue, they attract new audiences and offer a new way of funding conservation agencies who are making a real impact around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildcards 101</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wildcards + conservation partners: what’s in it for you?</strong></p>\n<p>Together, Wildcards and conservation partners are a win-win. Being a Wildcards conservation partner is free and carries no risk and no extra demands for the funding recipient. It gives conservation agencies and their cause exposure and allows them to tap into a unique, emerging global network of funders who operate within the cryptocurrency community.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*6mVuHkvF0xcszAvW\"></p>\n<p>Funders are typically from a tech background and are keen to contribute in a meaningful way to conservation. Wildcards are planning to tap into funders from the lucrative gaming industry next. Existing Wildcards conservation partners who are already benefiting from the Wildcards platform include<a href=\"http://www.sendaverde.org/\"> Senda Verde</a>,<a href=\"https://www.wildtomorrowfund.org/\"> Wild Tomorrow Fund</a>,<a href=\"http://darwinanimaldoctors.org/\"> Darwin Animal Doctors</a>,<a href=\"https://www.greatwhaleconservancy.org/\"> Great Whale Conservancy</a>,<a href=\"http://thebdi.org/\"> Biodiversity and Development Institute</a>,<a href=\"https://www.pangolin.africa/\"> Pangolin.Africa</a>,<a href=\"https://www.lemurconservationnetwork.org/\"> Lemur Conservation Network</a>,<a href=\"https://sharkspotters.org.za/\"> Shark Spotters</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.careforwild.co.za/\"> Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What are Wildcards and how does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>You publicly buy a virtual animal ‘wildcard’ online, which then makes you the guardian of that particular animal. Each wildcard is accompanied by that animal’s history and contains interesting facts about the animal. Each animal represents a conservation agency which helps to protect the actual individual animal or its species. When you buy a wildcard, you must also set the price you are willing to sell it for.</p>\n<p>Every month, the guardian of a wildcard gives a specified portion of the price they are willing to sell that wildcard for, to that animal’s representative conservation agency.</p>\n<p>I.e. You buy a wildcard, set its selling price to US$100, then because that wildcard has a 20% monthly donation you give US$20 a month to the conservation agency that animal represents.</p>\n<p>So at any point someone can buy the wildcard from you, if they are willing to pay the selling price you specified, because wildcards are always for sale. When someone buys the wildcard from you they must set a selling price. They, the new guardian of the wildcard, are then responsible for giving the new monthly donation. And so, the cycle continues the generation of funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Why buy wildcards: Gamified giving meets conservation commission</strong></p>\n<p>Each time a card is sold, revenue is collected by the outgoing guardian, a minimum of 5% of this revenue goes to running the Wildcards platform. Wildcard guardians get to support their favourite conservation agencies who are making real-world impacts. Wildcards also keeps its audience up to date with the work of its conservation partners and posts notifications of changes in the guardianship of a wildcard via social media. The awarding of badges, the celebration of giving streaks, and the guardianship-giving leaderboard is transparent and public, and acknowledges guardians for their giving.</p>\n<p><strong>The Beauty of Blockchain: Transactions are transparent, traceable in real-time, and there are no international banking fees</strong></p>\n<p>Transparency is at the core of Wildcards. At any point in time, anyone can instantly verify the movements of funds. Moreover, no one can cheat the mechanism and the flow of funds, because Wildcards uses blockchain technology. The beauty of blockchain is that it’s a decentralised database that’s distributed and duplicated on multiple computers at the same time, allowing interaction without the need for involving counterparties such as banks.</p>\n<p>As new records — known as “blocks” — are added, the blockchain grows. Each block contains links to the preceding blocks and has timestamps, thereby forming a chain. As funds are in the form of Ether, a cryptocurrency, there are no international transaction fees when people from abroad donate to your agency. 1 Ether is currently worth US$ 243,60. However, for now, converting Eth to your local currency will incur a small fee. This fee will likely drop in the future as more global commerce moves on to the blockchain and the technology improves. There are also plans to allow the use of stable cryptocurrencies whose coin value is fixed at 1 US$.</p>\n<p><strong>Crypto, gaming, giving: a new era for conservation funding</strong></p>\n<p>Well-known conservation agencies such as WWF already have extensive systems, platforms and long-standing audiences, but smaller conservation agencies and funds tend to fall through the gaps. They may not have access to the same reputation and legacy that prominent conservation agencies do or have the technical resources required to effectively raise funds in a digital age. However, the work they do is still hugely valued and critical to conserving wildlife. Instead of contributing to one, big, global fund, Wildcards is able to split its global giving to many small funds that each make a big difference on regional and local levels. Wildcards make sure that smaller conservations aren’t left behind while globalisation and new technologies continue to change the world to favour large organisations.</p>\n<p>With the world all but turned on its head and looking for fresh ways to reinvent itself, Wildcards has the potential to herald a new era of funding which is mutually beneficial and offers value along with visibility.</p>\n<p>Follow Wildcards on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow Wildcards on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Join us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 03, 2020","title":"Wildcards - an unprecedented means of funding conservation","description":"Wildcards is an unconventional strategy that is able to harness funding for conservation while simultaneously providing entertainment and dare we say, fun."}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Announcing Wildcards Conservation Partner - Wild Tomorrow Fund wild tomorrow fund We’re excited today to be telling you more about our very…","fields":{"slug":"/wild-tomorrow-fund-partnership/"},"html":"<h1>Announcing Wildcards Conservation Partner - Wild Tomorrow Fund</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://dd2wadt5nc0o7.cloudfront.net/conservations/banners/wild-tomorrow-fund-banner.jpg\" alt=\"wild tomorrow fund\" title=\"Wildcards x Wild Tomorrow Fund\"></p>\n<p>We’re excited today to be telling you more about our very first partnership, launched in October last year, with the incredible Wild Tomorrow Fund!</p>\n<p>As our partners say, “we want to ensure that the world that comes after us is a world in which a wild tomorrow is possible.”</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCW_qAtXQyw\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe></div> </div></p>\n<p>Wild Tomorrow fund works throughout Southern Africa protecting threatened and endangered species and the habitats they call home.

These features will expand the Wildcards ecosystem, ultimately helping us better connect global conservation organizations and users through a social, gamified, and transparent platform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://wildcards.world\">Wildcards</a> are NFTs, with each token representing a unique animal from one of our partner conservation organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Currently, every wildcard NFT is always for sale. This is because every wildcard guardian (owner) is required to set a selling price and pay a percentage of this selling price each month to our conservation partners. This concept is technically known as a Harberger tax.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpQCKoRvyR4\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe></div> </div></p>\n<p>Our new features will be based on randomness provided by Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Randomness Function). <a href=\"https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/\">Chainlink VRF</a> is a randomness solution for smart contracts, providing auditable, cryptographic guarantees that each random result is unbiased and fair.</p>\n<p>Chainlink VRF will allow us to expand the wildcards ecosystem and offer an exciting new line of collectible wildcards! We will introduce an ‘egg hatching’ mechanic in addition to our always for sale (Harberger-taxed) NFTs. We believe our users will enjoy this new collection method and populate their own virtual conservation wildernesses. We also look forward to rewarding active participants in the <a href=\"https://wildcards.world/#dao\">Wildcards conservation DAO</a> with random drawings for ultra-rare Wildcards.</p>\n<h2>Integration Details</h2>\n<p>Chainlink VRF enables our team to introduce two new collection mechanics to the Wildcards platform. These features will increase the number of Wildcard collectibles, and incentivize Wildcard guardians to actively participate in the governance of the Wildcards ecosystem. We expect to simultaneously attract new users to the platform and encourage further participation from current members.</p>\n<h3>Growing Wildcards supply with a hatching mechanic</h3>\n<p>Our Harberger-taxed NFTs are currently in limited supply based on our number of conservation partners and the animals they protect. With Chainlink VRF, we’ll be launching a new line of NFTs to make more Wildcards available for our users. The new collectibles will feature animals of varying rarities and breeds and be created through a randomized ‘hatching’ mechanism. The increase in the number of Wildcards will help us drive more funds towards conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ceda897a42df1a8c756f6de44420b120/e0885/hatching-wc.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 918px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 42.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAJCAIAAAC9o5sfAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAACF0lEQVQoz2NYfHr70tM7Fp3etuzQ5sUntz188/z//////v37DwN///0Fkpee3AmaVxk4vzJ2WWnylGzn/pzlZ3YxlO+YNO3c2v4jy8pWTyzZPe3QrXNgLf8+fPqz5+SHtx9//wNrnn1gA0OZHnuTrUihrlqMAkO5dsSiKoaF57ZWN9d3T+5dempbxdbpR29cgFi4fMebzYfePn/74+uP30DuykvbmOqsOGtcJAN0vUL0GEqNYubWMWw7spOHg5udjX1iT8fcXQv3XT8Nduq/p69/nr72efmO1xDN2x7tEuy1Noi2dLcxn+GrbB6hFD63lmHmmkUyUtKS0lKW5hYrT27de+0UUOnP3/++fP+35+THS7e+PX71Ayiy5OwWhgIjpUAjJwczFVMVUUeZ+Hm1DAt2rpYUEWdgYJATl5q0ceGxR1eASt+8//z67edv33/8/PXr7pOPQJG5B9fxFlpphdoJm8mqqClweirErWpkmHd83caDW7rmTJqxZlHnxjlHboP8/Ojxwzt3b716/fLVq5cfP70DiizYu46vzMxoqgd3sqlkkAFDvGbsgjqGvGXdrXvmNW6dXbtheuHSroPXQH5+/vL58xfPnz1//uTpk89fvwJF5uxZxeAnxVSgz5CgzhKqwuApHD6piGHl4e2rTuxafWLXmuM7Vx/a9vgV9ni+8eRu8qSq+Jl1ifMaUubVR3cVbjyxBwB1XVtvBSGG0AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"hatch-random-wildcard\"\n        title=\"Hatching a Random Wildcard\"\n        src=\"/static/ceda897a42df1a8c756f6de44420b120/e0885/hatching-wc.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ceda897a42df1a8c756f6de44420b120/63868/hatching-wc.png 250w,\n/static/ceda897a42df1a8c756f6de44420b120/0b533/hatching-wc.png 500w,\n/static/ceda897a42df1a8c756f6de44420b120/e0885/hatching-wc.png 918w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Loyalty token distribution and random rewards</h3>\n<p>In addition to a new line of wildcards NFTs, we will implement Chainlink VRF to incentivize Wildcards governance participation.

However, we are yet to see a flourishing of applications built with harberger tax. This article aims to make the code that is used to build wildcards easily accessible to the public. There are quite a few manual steps in this tutorial, but if you follow everything step by step you will be able to have a default working harberger tax application on Ethereum with a UI in under 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>There are more links and explanations marked with the heading <strong><em>Extra</em></strong>. We highly encourage you to go through these, but if you just want to get started they are not necessary (and they will cause you to take longer than 15 minutes). If something goes wrong check if there are any <strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> sections. Otherwise please create an issue on github</p>\n<p>Once you have completed the basic tutorial we will explore how to customize your application by modifying the contracts and extending the UI. This toolkit is designed to be easy to get started with, yet, (or so we hope) infinitely customizable.</p>\n<h2>Contents:</h2>\n<p>This tutorial has 3 parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First part is to deploy the smart contracts.</li>\n<li>Second part is to create a subgraph that allows you to easily query data from the blockchain.</li>\n<li>The final step is to run a sample UI</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Aside</em></strong>: While we truly love thegraph and the power it gives, it also adds quite a lot of config and complexity to an application. I wouldn’t recommend using the graph for very small and quick projects, for that it is simpler to just query blockchain data directly from the blockchain via a provider such as <a href=\"https://infura.io\">infura.io</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get the contracts and deploy them.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Extra</em></strong>: These contracts use <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk\">Zeppelin-SDK</a> to allow them to be up-gradable. Please go through their <a href=\"https://openzeppelin.com/sdk/\">docs</a> carefully to understand what this means and the requirements if you wish to upgrade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clone the repository and install the dependencies:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/wildcards-world/harberger-base-contracts.git\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> harberger-base-contracts\n<span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># You can also use `npm install` but yarn is recommended.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Then deploy the contracts to the goerli test network:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> migrate --network goerli</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: This command will take a few minutes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: If there is an issue with this command it is likely that someone has used/stolen all the goerli testnet eth that is stored by the private key hardcoded in this repo. Another possibility is that the infura keys are exhausted (since they are on free tier). Generate new keys <a href=\"https://iancoleman.io/bip39/\">here</a> and paste them into <code class=\"language-text\">./secrectsManager.example.js</code> to replace the old private key. If you want to use your own infura keys, generate them <a href=\"https://infura.io/\">here</a> and paste your keys into <code class=\"language-text\">./secrectsManager.example.js</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should output something similar to this on completion.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/InsmRtH.png\" alt=\"Expected Output\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Extra</em></strong>: these contracts currently use <a href=\"https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration\">truffle</a> + <a href=\"https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache\">ganache</a>, but over time the goal is to move it completely to <a href=\"https://buidler.dev/\">buidler</a>. At the moment you will find traces of configuration for both in the repo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that the contract is deployed to the goerli testnet we need to get the contract addresses. It is found in the <code class=\"language-text\">./openzeppelin/goerli.json</code> file near the bottom under <code class=\"language-text\">proxies &gt; &quot;the contract name&quot; &gt; address</code> as shown below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GrASHKv.png\" alt=\"where-to-find-contract-addresses\">\nIn our case the address for the <em>HarbergerSteward</em> is <code class=\"language-text\">0x4bE0Eab8f41c8109AA134509086Cbcb18b10C0fB</code> and for the <em>ERC721Patronage</em> it is <code class=\"language-text\">0x48C12e1c5aBC5239FD6e2642C929E8FA8bE29999</code> - we will use these in the next steps, so keep them somewhere for reference.</p>\n<h2>Create a subgraph</h2>\n<p>This repo allows us to read data from the ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Extra</em></strong>: the subgraph is provided by thegraph.com . It uses graphQL which is a specification for how to structure data requests and it is a powerful tool because it allows you to fetch exactly the data you want from the graph. The UI library uses a library called <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\">apollo</a> to fetch the data from the subgraph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Get the code and install the dependencies by running the following in a new terminal and folder:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/wildcards-world/harberger-base-subgraph.git\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> harberger-base-subgraph\n<span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># Once again, you can use `npm install` if you prefer.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Next you will need to create an account with <a href=\"https://thegraph.com\">the Graph</a>. Once you have an account go to your dashboard and click the button that says “Add Subgraph” in the top right corner:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PsaZYQa.png\" alt=\"create-graph-button\"></p>\n<p>Fill in your preferred details for your new subgraph:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DEnfDNu.png\" alt=\"create-graph\">\nOnce created it will present you with some default instructions. I have summarised them below.</p>\n<p>Install thegraph cli tool:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --global @graphprotocol/graph-cli</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: this command will take some time, so feel free to continue in the meantime. You do need this command to run the <code class=\"language-text\">graph auth</code> command below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Authenticate with thegraph. Copy the code in the top bar and run it in the following command:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WlMCvdP.png\" alt=\"secret-graph-code\"></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>ACCESS_TOKEN<span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token comment\"># find this access token as circled in the image above.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9v6fsfP.png\" alt=\"success example\"></p>\n<p>You are ready to test deploying this graph. First change the <em>package.json</em> to point to the correct subgraph:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ptkktvU.png\" alt=\"set-upstream-graph-endpoint\"></p>\n<p>For example if you github name is “jasoons” and your new subgraph is called “harberger-app” you should set this line to say <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;graph deploy --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ jasoons/harberger-app&quot;,</code></p>\n<p>Next you need to auto-generate some setup code:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> codegen</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Extra</em></strong>: you will need to run this anytime you change the abi (which you will need to change anytime you change the interface of your contract) or your <code class=\"language-text\">subgraph.yaml</code> file. It generates helper code based on the interface (abi) of your contracts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You are now ready to deploy this version of the subgraph, but will it deploy the correct subgraph for your contracts? The answer is no, you need to tell the graph to watch the contracts you deployed in the previous step. To do that edit the <code class=\"language-text\">subgraph.yaml</code> file with the addresses that you deployed earlier:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/57uJWiN.png\" alt=\"set-contracts-in-graph\"></p>\n<p>Now run the deploy script with the correct contract addresses</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> deploy</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yyIGV4S.png\"></p>\n<p>Go to back your graph, reload the page and check that everything is working. It should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XUk7WyD.png\" alt=\"thegraph-playground\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Extra</em></strong>: The docs for thegraph.com are excelent. Do yourself a favour and read through them thoroughly, thegraph will likely help you build on Ethereum for many future projects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Setup the basic UI</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/wildcards-world/harberger-ui.git\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> harberger-ui\n<span class=\"token function\">yarn</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> re:build</code></pre></div>\n<p>The UI is configured to run with a single simple command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> start</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>EXTRA</em></strong>: You can do all your coding in Javascript or Typescript, however you can also use ReasonMl which is a new typesafe language which is being pioneered by facebook.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now you will need to set the contract address of the steward and the graph endpoint of your subgraph.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1sseS1J.png\"></p>\n<p>You should be able to now buy token #0 (the starter code has this value hardcoded) via the UI and set its price. To use the UI you will need to have the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\">metamask</a>.</p>\n<p>To hit the ground running with your own custom UI code you will need to start with the <code class=\"language-text\">app.js</code> file.

I.e. a vote of size 9 will have a power of 3, a vote of size 100 will only have a power 10 etc. The desired result is that users with large amounts of voting power cannot radically swing the result toward one specific candidate. \nThe idea of Quadratic voting is explored extensively in the book, Radical Economics, and therefore named after one author Glen Weyl.</p>\n<p>Who gets to vote?\nAnyone who is the guardian of a wildcard, is rewarded with 1 wildcard loyalty token per day. The guardian can then use these loyalty tokens to vote for the conservation that they believe should receive the funds raised from Glen the Dragon. The vote will happen on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>That’s it! We are super stoked that we managed to nab 3rd place at the ETHTurin hackathon.

As I work from home in this tumultuous time, I thought it was a great opportunity to share our experience. Especially since CV Labs has opened applications for their Batch 3 in October 2020.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fPVMI3wC8GEDyTbb1lYC0g.png\" alt=\"Sun setting in Zug\"><em>Sun setting in Zug</em></p>\n<p>The incubator is run in Zug, the heart of the Crypto Valley. Where the ethereum foundation was born and notable blockchain companies like Tezos, Cardano and Bitcoin Suisse still operate. Switzerland itself is another world, where ubers are teslas and it’s immaculate cleanliness makes you think there should be a tier above first world.</p>\n<p>The program runs over 10 intensive weeks where they cover 5 core pillars</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perfecting your pitch</li>\n<li>Strategy and team</li>\n<li>Blockchain and tokenomics</li>\n<li>Business (marketing, operations, sales)</li>\n<li>Funding (data room and raising funds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first 2 weeks are by far the most hands-on with back to back workshops overseen by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henar-acebes/\">Heny</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolai-reinbold-30aa1995/\">Nicolai</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-jakovlev-mba/\">Pavel</a>. By the end of the first two weeks you have a well-refined pitch deck and can pitch your startup upside down in swiss german, not really though, the program is run in English.</p>\n<p>The first month after that is focussed on product and technical which consists of a series of workshops. Some I, personally, found slightly too blockchain 101 while others left the marketing founders wondering if zkSNARKs was a constellation or satoshis real name.</p>\n<p>The following and final 4 weeks help you traverse the complicated legal and regulatory waters of blockchain and the world of finance and fundraising followed by some practical business essentials like sales and marketing, my personal favorite workshops with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamdanram/\">I AM DAN RAM</a>.</p>\n<p>The incubator came to a close in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, something my dad was particularly jealous of, followed by a final private investor dinner with CVVC’s personal network.</p>\n<p>The CV Labs incubator runs deeper than a series of workshops though. The program provides great opportunities to network and get in front of influential people. We had the opportunity to pitch our start-up to the University of Zurich’s blockchain masters graduates, present alongside Glen Weyl at ETH Zurich and in Davos during the World Economic Forum. Along the journey they assign you an external mentor, we were fortunate to be mentored by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilorincz/\">Emi Lorincz</a>. We even had a visit to CV Labs Lichtenstein which I still kind of think is just a town in Switzerland with their own laws. One of my favorite workshops was ‘founders for founders’. Where the 4 founders¹ of CVVC host an interactive evening where they share stories from their ventures, success’s and ‘fuck ups’.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasetter/\">Lukas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-neupert-71921537/\">Pascal</a> head the investment decisions, both with impressive education and career backgrounds, and are in charge of choosing the cream of the crop startups worthy of CVVC funding and the CV Labs incubator.</p>\n<p>They have a sensible valuation strategy where they invest based on the stage of your startup’s commercial development rather than some complicated discounted cash flows on an early-stage venture. Thus they categorize startups into two tiers, early-stage and early stage with a little more traction. It’s clear that these aren’t strict rules though and that they evaluate each company on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>At the end of the program, you come out with a killer pitch, a rock-solid business plan, a minimum viable product / minimum marketable product and on a personal level, astute for any future meeting with an experienced investor. A robust foundation, well suited to raising your next round.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional links</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/cv-vc/kicking-off-cv-labs-incubation-batch-5f4f6c816fad\">CV Labs Batch 2 </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://breakermag.com/switzerlands-crypto-valley-birthed-ethereum-and-never-lost-its-cool/\">Crypto Valley</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.f6s.com/cvincubation/about\">Incubator Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QfhlIUmk_4Q\">Zug at sunset</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] Four CVVC founders: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/olaf-hannemann-360588/\">Olaf Hannemann</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcobumbacher/\">Marco Bumbacher</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathiasruch/\">Mathias Ruch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralfglabischnig\">Ralf Glabischnig</a></p>\n<p>Follow Wildcards on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow Wildcards on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Join Wildcards on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 21, 2020","title":"What it’s like to attend a swiss blockchain incubator","description":"In October last year, we had the privilege of attending the CV Labs Incubator program as part of their batch 2"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Wildcards is excited to announce a new feature, cryptographically verifiable attestations of identity!

If you believe that people today or in the future will value and appreciate that you did a good deed of donating money to a wildlife conservation, then your contribution is an investment into your reputation. Dollars and Euros are not the only things that people value, thankfully.</p>\n<p>It works the other way around too! Everyone has existing social capital, and validating your identity to owning a Wildcard imbues some of that social capital to the Wildcard. And this has the potential to make the wildcard more valuable, which thankfully isn’t a selfish thing — wildcards never stop generating funds for wildlife conservation.</p>\n<h4>Here is a concrete example from Wildcards history:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>On <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc5d83b4bca45495fbb26c52ff08b6b4b30659716d4fa3ccdfc0cf35adadb42c9\">_Jun-27–2019 04:46:08 PM +UT_C</a> <a href=\"https://wildcards.world/#details/vitalik\">Vitalik</a> was born. He cost 0 ether — humble beginnings.</li>\n<li>Over the next day it was traded and the price was changed a number of times. It price fluctuated, and it changed hands: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1d41bebcec93a17ebbd13897a0a57c0f316c06681839be9094ef03224e7a0252\">0.0002</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89d1c1dc0f712aa90e3d820a92d2b3e64cbc3826dd7a76f932a023e002a820f6\">0.4</a> ETH, …<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc06e9f1dae62c92905712362715eadb84c8ef48056ee67ffd1a178d6faafe5bd\">, 0.15</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61d7cc955bcfe42c81a3c557f7cc5c610cdaf0042d74cb8c628f64de1eaa588d\">0.25</a> ETH, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5252f6c22288950b92997934a3491656f2c12f7ba1299902f61eef4806312455\">1.7</a> ETH. All this time Wildcards was generating money for wildlife conservation.</li>\n<li>And then, on the Jun-28–2019 09:31:46 AM +UTC, it was bought for 1.7 ETH and the price was set to 20ETH (3665.80 USD) by someone who clearly believes in our project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vitalik has a monthly pledge rate of 2.5% of its self assessed value. This means at its current price of 20ETH the owner pays 0.5 ETH (91.54 USD)per month to hold this token. This means that if someone buys Vitalik from them for 20ETH within 36.6 months they make a guaranteed profit. I would say that is a decent amount of incentive for someone to use their social capital to promote Wildcards and its case. And thus — the idea of <a href=\"https://blog.simondlr.com/exploring-harberger-tax-in-patronage-markets\">Patronage Markets</a> starts to come into reality.</p>\n<p>As it happens, we do know who the owner of Vitalik is, and they have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simondlr/status/1144540641516539904\">been public about it</a>. But we hope to make this easier for other patrons on the Wildcards platform in the future.</p>\n<p>We are constantly working on new features to further integrate the human and fun side of patronage markets via gamification, stay tuned as these new ideas are implemented.</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 22, 2019","title":"Let the world know about your contributions","description":"Wildcards is excited to announce a new feature, cryptographically verifiable attestations of identity!"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Where is the money going?

It signifies that this is actually working, and money is going to beloved animals we are trying to protect. So, let’s break this number down step by step to help quantify its impact so far. \n It is:\n1 buffalo reintroduced into the wild or\n2 months of a ranger’s salary or\n3 times 0.843 Eth or \n…\n2022 bananas\nOne more crucial figure… it is only 0.0000006% of the <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/conservation-will-cost-76-billion-40357\">yearly amount</a> needed to preserve conservation! Basically, we are just getting started and have ambitious goals to drastically increase this number.</p>\n<h2>Is team wildcards going to raise a bunch of money then flee to the Bahamas and listen to No Women No Cry while buying cocktails with bitcoin?</h2>\n<p>Obviously, this is a valid concern, we love Bob Marley. In serious terms, we recognize that the money cannot continue to flow through us toward the conservation, as this requires everyone to trust team wildcards, and we all know that is the thing least liked by the decentralized community. \nLuckily we are flipping Ninjas when it comes to smart contracts and so we can change the address that receives the funds. The funds generated will flow directly to the public address of an organization. The organization will verify their address on twitter or through their website. Trust is then held at the organization level.</p>\n<p>Visit our website <a href=\"https://wildcards.world\">Wildcards</a> where you can buy some wildcards and start contributing toward at risk animal conservation today!

Surely blockchain, the foundation of bitcoin, the pioneer of decentralized finance, can be extended to solve some of humanities greatest problems? This was our motivation.</p>\n<p>After a few german beers and lots of ideation on the Friday night preceding the hackathon, we believed we had found a way to create a well incentivized, transparent carbon credit market. Overall it would be useful in stimulating carbon offset farming and combating climate change. Come on boys, lets make Greta proud!</p>\n<h3>Supply?</h3>\n<p>Coming from South Africa, we were aware of a special plant called spekboom that is cheap, easy to grow in arid land, and very effective at offsetting carbon emissions. Why not grow spekboom in idle, arid landscapes in the karoo of South Africa to offset carbon emissions?</p>\n<h3>Demand?</h3>\n<p>Energy use and hence emission levels are predicted to keep rising over time. Entities and individuals are interested in an easy and transparent solution to verify that they have offset their carbon emissions, and are thus carbon neutral.</p>\n<h3>Linking supply and demand</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://carboncredits.club/\">Carboncredits.club</a> combines interesting economic mechanisms with cutting edge tech in order to link carbon offsetting farmers to entities worldwide in a radical new market.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The farmers will grow hectares of spekboom plantation that will be represented as NFT’s.</li>\n<li>Each hectare of spekboom offsets 10 tons of carbon emission per year.</li>\n<li>Entities/individuals will buy these spekboom NFTs, where the holder of a NFT has the right to claim the carbon offset from that particular NFT.</li>\n<li>When holding a spekboom NFT, erc20 tokens, called ‘Carbon Credits’ are automatically minted and credited to your public address over time as you hold the NFT.</li>\n<li>I.e. If you hold a 1 hectare spekboom NFT for 1 year, 10 carbon credits will have been minted and sent to your account (all handled transparently and programmatically through our smart contract implementation).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here it starts to get interesting!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure a liquid market and incentivize the farmers, spekboom NFT’s are always for sale.</li>\n<li>Whenever the NFT is bought, immediately the buyer must set a new selling price.</li>\n<li>The buyer then pays a percentage of that selling price each month toward the farmer, as a fee for holding the right to claim the carbon offset generated by that land.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entities are finally able to ‘burn’ carbon credits, to verifiably and transparently show the amount (tons) of carbon they have offset.</p>\n<p>All this results in some cool outcomes like a transparent secondary market for carbon credit trading, as well as introducing the chance for early adopters to even profit through the higher resale of their spekboom NFT’s as demand for carbon credits increase.</p>\n<p>Want to learn more?

Inspired by Simon de la Rouviere’s <a href=\"https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/\">This Artwork is Always on Sale</a> and Glen Weyl and Eric Posner’s <a href=\"http://radicalmarkets.com/\">Radical Markets</a>. We’ve got it!</p>\n<p>We start coding again. Renewed energy, we have this! We help ourselves to more free food and refreshments, organic energy drinks and kombucha. We code, we think, we talk, we get mentored by the network of incredible mentors and we code some more. Around midnight we are treated to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/larozell/\">authentic crêpes</a>. The team is squinting into our computers by 4:30 am. There are still 50 or so, out of the 190 hackers suited in hoodies and headphones hacking around us, some sleeping at the table. We retreat to one of the previous talk venues to where mattresses have been laid out. We cross Andy Tudhope, one of EthCapeTown’s Judges from <a href=\"https://status.im/\">Status</a>, reading his book. We “team sleep” for 2 hours and wake up back to our computers where the sun is rising through the glass ocean-facing wall.</p>\n<p>At some point, Vitalik nonchalantly arrives and sits at one of the desks at his Thinkpad. EthCapeTown is waking up again and the food trucks open their flaps. We are frantically coding trying to build a working product. We deploy to the testnet, we spruce up the front end and with 3min to go, we make a video demo to explain what we built. We are finished, physically too, the hacking is over, its time for presentations.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/c08c5/ethcapetown.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Winners\"\n        title=\"Wildcards are winners of EthCapeTown 2019\"\n        src=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/c08c5/ethcapetown.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/0479a/ethcapetown.jpg 250w,\n/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/41099/ethcapetown.jpg 500w,\n/static/3e5b82c810263fb074dc850ac45363f5/c08c5/ethcapetown.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>We watch the other awesome projects present through fuzzy brains.

Hence, we say that our wildcards are ‘always for sale’.</p>\n<h2>How are wildcards always for sale?</h2>\n<p>This is what is actually super cool and unique about wildcards. We have leveraged an idea from a book called ‘radical markets’, that proposes a fascinating ‘always for sale mechanism’.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, whenever someone buys a wildcard, they are immediately required to set a selling price for that wildcard. Therefore, the wildcard can at anytime be bought for that selling price, and is ‘always for sale’. The interesting economic dynamic is that the owner of the wildcard pays a percentage based fee on the selling price they set (known as harberger tax).\nIf you are lost… don’t worry — we made this cool little video which should hopefully explain it a bit better :)</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/63qtVVmcpmU\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe></div> </div></p>\n<h2>Why are we in Paris?</h2>\n<p>Our team was selected to be part of Ubisoft Entrepreneurs lab in Station F, Paris. See below…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As part of the Strategic Innovation Lab, the Ubisoft Entrepreneurs Lab’s mission is to team up with innovative startups to explore technologies or trends that might become critical for Ubisoft in the future. We work with each startup batch for a six-month long season, striving to create valuable collaborations between each startup and the Ubisoft Group as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Shhhh… we have partnered with an amazing conservation organisation that will help distribute funds generated from this project. More details to follow soon!\nMore good news! We are going to release a bunch of new wildcards next week — and more and more over the coming weeks and months during our time in Paris!</p>\n<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>\n<p>Visit our website <a href=\"https://wildcards.world\">Wildcards</a> where you can go ahead, buy a wildcard, and start contributing toward at risk animal conservation.</p>\n<p>Follow our socials to learn more about our project and the conservation causes we are working towards.</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wildcards_world\">@wildcards_world</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildcardscrypto\">@wildcardscrypto</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/wildcardsworld\">Telegram</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/55b1e489873ad2174c5459e1b6f1e3dc/thuggorilla.gif\" alt=\"thuglife\" title=\"Thuglife harberger tax\"></p>\n<p>Stay tuned,</p>\n<p>Team Wildcards</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 09, 2019","title":"Welcome to wildcards","description":"Wildcards is always for sale conservation crypto tokens built on Ethereum."}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
