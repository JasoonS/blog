We’re excited today to be talking about one of our first and favourite conservation partners, La Senda Verde!

La Senda Verde has spent the last 15 years fighting the illegal wildlife trade in Bolivia, helping to rehabilitate the animals rescued from this cruel trade.

The partnership will see more funds being raised for La Senda Verde’s conservation efforts through the wildcards platform.

Tarkus the bear is one of the many animals being cared for at La Senda Verde. You can become the guardian of [him](https://wildcards.world/#explorer/details/15) today and start supporting La Senda Verde’s amazing conservation efforts.
