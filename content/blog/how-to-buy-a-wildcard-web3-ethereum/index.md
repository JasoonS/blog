### Why are there so many options to buy a wildcard?

## Smart contracts

Wildcards uses something called ‘smart-contracts’ which are essentially decentralised pieces of code we deploy to ensure our application is transparent and acts automatically how we intended (i.e. funds will transparently flow to the conservation organisations etc…).

## Ethereum

We use a network called ethereum (a type of blockchain), to facilitate this entire process.

Therefore, in order to buy a wildcard, you will need eth, the currency of ethereum, and this will allow you to interact with our smart contracts and buy a wildcard.

Wait… one more thing. How do you get hold of eth?

Well… you buy it. Next question, how do I buy it and how do I use it?

## Web3 provider

Here you will use something called a ‘web3 provider’. This is a 3rd party application that will allow you to hold eth and interact with an ‘decentralised application (app)’ like wildcards running on ethereum.

We have given you 6 different web3 provider options to use and facilitate this process. Each has a slightly different way of working that may suit you best. E.g.
Torus (with google), lets you create an account with google then fund your account using a credit card. See a summary at the end of the web3 providers.

## I need help

We are on crisp (chat tool bottom right of wildcards website) to help walk you through the entire process if you are lost :)

## Why is this so hard?

Blockchain is the bleeding edge of technology and still has a long way to go. Don’t worry, as soon as things become easier, we will update our website accordingly.

## So what are my options?
