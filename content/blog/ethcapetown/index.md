# What its like to attend a hackathon like EthCapeTown

Armed to the teeth with brains and Jon Jon, the wildcards team attended EthCapeTown. Of course at this point we were merely good friends from University. Unbeknowingly about to fall upon a revolutionary conservation funding model. A self regulated open market place leveraging Harberger Tax and incentives to create a new conservation patronage asset class. Wildcards. 

The team, 4 developers strong, passionate about our planet, embarked on 48 hours of non stop hacking. 9 hours in, at 3am, we weren't a line of code in. Still in debate on what we were buidling. On the fence between a crowd funding student education app and a gambling app with a simple but difficult to implement mechanic. The team retreated to our closest home and had a deep sleep on slightly too short couches. 

9am sharp! we were outside the most luxury line of Cape Towns finest food trucks. EthCapeTown spoiling its hackers with all you can eat buffet of food trucks. I'm still reminiscing thinking of its delicacies. 

We start coding, stop coding, scrap that code. 3pm we starting thinking about conservation tokens, precisely somewhere around 2 minutes later, Jon Jon comes up with the idea to marry conservation tokens and always for sale. Inspired by [https://blog.simondlr.com/](Simon de la Rouviere)
